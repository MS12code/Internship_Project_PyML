## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model for diabetes using machine learning algorithms. The project utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to train and evaluate the model.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. The dataset is publicly available and can be found at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/pima+indians+diabetes).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MS12code/Internship_Project_PyML.git
   ```



2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Internship_Project_PyML
   ```



3. **Install the required packages:**

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment. Install the dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```



*Note: If `requirements.txt` is not provided, ensure the following packages are installed:*

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
* jupyter([GitHub][1], [ardalis.com][2])

### Option 2: Local Machine

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```



2. **Open the notebook:**

   Navigate to `Python_ML_Diabetes_Prediction_.ipynb` and open it.

3. **Run the cells:**

   Execute each cell sequentially to reproduce the results.

## Results

The machine learning model achieved an accuracy of **X%** on the test dataset. The confusion matrix and ROC curve are included in the notebook for detailed evaluation.

*Note: Replace **78%** with the actual accuracy obtained.*
